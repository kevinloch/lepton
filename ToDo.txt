To Do:
 - Improve speed of phase 1 and phase 2 for difficult formulas (generally those with sequential high inverse exponents like E+24+25+26)
 - Test for ratios of reference masses in coefficient factors and/or constant term
 - Support for four term formulas without constant term (one zero mass root and three real positive mass roots)
 - Support for some limited rational exponents (2/x, 3/x, etc.)
