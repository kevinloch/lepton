4.3  New features:
     - Support for reference mass ratios (rmr) outside radical
     - More options for controlling verbosity of status output
     - New configuration option nle_mixing_polarity for 2-term with (1-smr) mode.   Status updates now indicate polarity
     - Setting phase1_random_samples_enable to 'no' now also causes phase1 to be run just once instead of continuously

     Bug fixes:
     - Fixed bug in srcipts/grep-logs.sh that was writing meta refresh line to wrong file
     - selectOutputs() now checks that both the primary reference mass and sm3 are floated (solved for) in 2-term (1-smr) mode to ensure convergance

4.2  New features: 
     - Added support for (1-smr) mode. Enable by setting smrfactor_1minus_enable=yes and nle_mode=2.  Negative exponents
         are disabled in this mode, term1 must have an odd exponent (for when 1-smr is negative), and both terms will use the same smr including reference mass.
     - Added support for two additional user-supplied factors for outside radical for total of three
     - Added phase1_random_samples_enable option.  When set to "no" variables are all set to center of experimental range each time phase1 is run
     - Phase 1 core functions are now using long doubles (80-bit extended precision on x86) and solve down to <=1.0E-16 precision
     - Symmetry score now has more checks
     - Complexity score now ignores 1's in rationals for better selection of simplest duplicate formula
     Bug Fixes:
     - Fixed several logic bugs in interesting() that were causing many factors to not be found
     - Fixed bug in verifyMatches() that was generating incorrect formula hashes and allowing duplicate formulas

4.1  - Fixed bug in selectOutputs() that would not allow user-defined mass to be used as output
     - Fixed bug in generateExponents() that affected term3 when exp_neg_enable=no
     - Fixed bug in http results upload that would filter some results even when phase2_results_always=yes
     - Updated default Higgs boson reference value to 125.35 +/- 0.15 GeV published by CMS collaboration 
         https://cds.cern.ch/record/2691211/files/HIG-19-004-pas.pdf
     - term_id is now used as key in match tables instead of exp_inv
     - Initial development support for 2-term mixed (squared) mode, where a third term is generated synthetically from two base terms.
  
4.0  - First version to use an external configuration file (nle-lepton.cfg) to set search parameters
     - See nle-lepton.cfg for complete list of supported options
     - New types nle_config_t and nle_state_t greatly simplify arguments passed between functions

3.41 - Renamed project from polylepton to nle-lepton (nle = non-linear equation) since we are not working with true polynomials and
       to avoid confusion with multi-lepton decay processes
     - Renamed 'poly' string variable to 'exponents', changed other occurrances of poly or polyform to NLE, exponents or other appropriate words
     - Split monolithic source file into multiple files and added a basic Makefile
     - Renamed ALWAYSSHOWRESULTS compile time option to ALWAYS_SHOW_RESULTS

3.40 - Added ALWAYSSHOWRESULTS compile time option
     - Added consistency check requiring all three terms to have the same type of n-ball volume or n-sphere surface area factors
     - Now displays formula key in results output (L-M+R-1=0) along with term label (L,M,R) for each term formula
     - Increased support range of phase 1 filter to [3..6]
     - Support in phase 2 for solving for any variable including me and alpha
     - tmpmatchcomplexity is now calculated correctly in verifyMatches()

3.39 - Expanded supported dimensions from 12 to 26
     - Removed a^9 factor from M/mp mass ratio (this arbitrary scaling factor is not needed with higher dimensions)
     - Removed sqrt(2) factor from M/v mass ratio, as sqrt(2) inside radical is already included in initMultiplierArray()
     - Significant changes to phase 1  and phase 2 algorythims to be faster and more reliable
     - Phase 1 now uses electron mass as a temporary reference mass, actual reference masses are now introduced in cscanner()
     - Phase 1 and 2 now always solves all polyforms. Low dimension and mixed dimension polyforms are solved quickly.  Polyforms
       with sequential dimensions and especially higher sequential dimensions can take a long time to solve (over an hour in some cases).
     - Renamed project from 'lepton' to 'polylepton'

3.38 - Minor changes to phase 1 algorithm solvePolyForCoefficients() improves the solving difficult polyforms (like P+10+11+12)
     - Phase 2 solvePolyforMasses() now uses long double instead of double floating point
     - Phase 2 samplelimit increased (allows more phase 2's to be solved but slows the ones that fail to solve)
     - Compile time option IGNORE_SMALL_UNCERTAINTIES fixes alpha_em and electron mass to exact values for up to 4x phase 2 speedup
     - Version variable is now char[20] instead of float
     - Phase 1 output now part of "status" output instead of "search"
     - Cosmetic changes to some debug output

3.37 - first GitHub release
