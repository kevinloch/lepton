To Do:
 - Improve speed of phase 1 and phase 2 for difficult polyforms
 - Support for four term polyforms without constant term (one zero mass root and three real positive mass roots)
 - Support for some limited rational exponents (2/x, 3/x, but always < 1).   This is intended to represent converting radius derived from a 1/x exponent to a 2 or 3 dimensinal surface/volume on some (or all) term(s)
 - Split monolithic source file into separate files for easier readability/maintainability
