To Do:
 - Load reference values (currently in global.c), config and runtime options from a configuration file
 - Improve speed of phase 1 and phase 2 for difficult formulas (generally those with sequential high inverse exponents like E+24+25+26)
 - Test for ratios of reference masses in coefficient factors and/or constant term
 - Support for either (1 - M/mr) or (M/mr) on each term (currently just M/mr is supported)
 - Support for two term squared (to generate three terms from the original two) formulas
 - Support for four term formulas without constant term (one zero mass root and three real positive mass roots)
 - Support for some limited rational exponents (2/x, 3/x, but always < 1).   This is intended to represent converting radius derived from a 1/x exponent to a 2 or 3 dimensinal surface/volume on some (or all) term(s)
